# 1. Chose the dataset with images (FOR CLASSIFICATION) from sugessted or you could prepare own (find in kaggle or create).
Created own dataset gives additional points in the final mark (100-200 images on each class).

# 2. Train the same data (but with different data preparation stages) for Convolutional and Fullyconnected NNs.
0. Prepare you data, download into folders, preproces, rescale, etc.
1. Train fullyconnected NN on your selected dataset in the similar manner to example
2. Train convolutional NN on your selected dataset in the similar manner to example
